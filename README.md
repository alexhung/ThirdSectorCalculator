ThirdSectorCalculator
=====================

A Windows Phone 7 app that calculate the third sector lap time in a Formula 1 lap.

I created this app since the game F1 2011 has a bug where in qualifying mode the lap time display does not show the third sector time of the lap, thus making it very difficult to compare that sector time against the computer drivers.

I also wanted to discover how to program for WP7 as I already had lots of experience with iOS and a little bit of Android.
